			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				A collection of complementing texts that discuss the various motivations behind branding in the current age. From tech companies to fast food chains, museums to insurance companies, the push to lean on brand consistency to construct the perception of organizational stability and consumer trustworthiness can be credited for this heightened corporate appreciation for "the&nbsp;brand".</p>

			<h3> Mascots as Brand</h3> 
				
				<p>The article explores the challenge and opportunity of evolving brand personalities over time through the use of mascots. This approach takes pressure away from over-branding with type or pushing a strong visual identity that may not age well over time. Mascots however, can (relatively) easily go through character evolutions that help them stay relevant, or convey altered brand messages to suit the era they&nbsp;serve. </p>

<h3>Optimization as Art</h3>

<p> Visual design, primarily branding has taken on a more aspirational rather than representative role in the twentieth century. A variety of forces are credited for this paradigm shift. Apart from the expected political and economic pressures, limitations of mass market consumer technology, and an evolving view of what constitutes elevated brand equity over the years have been some of the rather unsuspected contributors to the field of corporate&nbsp;design.</p>

<h3> Brand as Public Imagination </h3>

<p> When Estonia set out to rebrand itself to the world, it faced the task of distilling history, perceptions and visions of the future in one singular tone. While the challenges of branding entire nations are significant, so are the risks of under-branded national identity - like in the case of Kazakhstan where the stereotypical narrative pushed in the movie Borat stained its global image. The article explores networking branding, politics of representation in national branding, and an understanding of what America's national brand is&nbsp;becoming.</P>
